# Punity
Punity (*noun: punishment, punitiveness*) is a 2D game 
engine targeted to the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller,
designed with Unity as an inspiration.

In this implementation, the Screen is using a ST7735
controller. You will also find logic for interfacing
analog joysticks and buttons.

### Extra info
This project has been made for an university task.

Check out [my previous attempt](https://github.com/extremq/pico_game/)
at creating such a game engine. I've learnt from that
and moved on to creating Punity just a few days later.
